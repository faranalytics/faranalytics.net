                <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was

                    will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                    explorer
                    of
                    the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
                    itself,
                    because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
                    encounter
                    consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
                    to
                    obtain
                    pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
                    pain
                    can
                    procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
                    physical
                    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
                    who
                    chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
                    produces no
                    resultant pleasure?</p>
